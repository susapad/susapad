## FAQ

### Why MiniPad's firmware?

Well, *Minipad Firmware* is *GPL-3.0* licensed,
what means that we can have some advantage as final users.
Such as rights to use, study, modify, distribute, and others...

For this project, *Minipad Firmware* is still the same, as it is,
without any modification in the source code.

You can use other firmware if you want or even create your own.

*SusaPad* comes with pre-installed *Minipad Firmware* at [*2023.410.1* version][minipad-release].
But you can easily update this by draging and dropping the `uf2` file
inside your *SusaPad* while in boot mode.

### Relationships

We are independent a project.
But is good to mention that we were allowed
to sell our keypads by minisbett, the creator of MiniPad.


### Can I use other firmware?

Yes, you can! As said, *SusaPad* is just a *keypad*, 
you can change whatever you want.
But, some changes can leave you to have some incompatibilities with 
*SusaPad Software* that was made to configure using *Minipad Firmware*.
Being said that, you also can change *SusaPad Software* if you want to.
